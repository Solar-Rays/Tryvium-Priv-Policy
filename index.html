                    <p>
                        The Site may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us
                        and which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot

                    <p>
                        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
                        purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or
                        permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
                        information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example,
                        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
                        deletion is possible.

                    <p>
                        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
                        designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
                        please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.
                        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of
                        personal information to and from our Site is at your own risk. You should only access
